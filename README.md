In January 2020, the MLB confirmed that the Houston Astros had used technology to steal signs in the 2017 and 2018 seasons. Statistics show that their plate discipline and runs produced were significantly better when comparing the 2016 and 2017 seasons and their home vs. away games. An important takeaway from this scandal is that being able to predict a pitch is hugely valuable to a team's success.
